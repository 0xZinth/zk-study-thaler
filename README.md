## Note ahead of first session

The first couple of sessions won't really need technical background. I'll give a high-level overview of the SNARK design landscape (basically an updated version of Chapters 1 and 19), as well as an overview of the relative cost of key SNARK operations. 

After that we'll start at the beginning of the book. 

People generally feel more comfortable if they've seen some finite fields and elliptic curves before, but you really don't need that knowledge. So I'd suggest perusing the following links, but keeping in mind the content really isn't needed:

- [Number Theory](https://explained-from-first-principles.com/number-theory/#contributions)
- [The Animated Elliptic Curve](https://curves.xargs.org/)
