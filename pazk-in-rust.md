## from thor314 git hub repo - Protocols to be implemented in the PAZK study group

A list of protocols to be implemented in Rust and Python by me over the course of the Thaler Study club, run out of the ZK hack discord server, published at github.com/thor314/pazk, in the (approximate) period April 2022-December 2022. The list is subject to change.
